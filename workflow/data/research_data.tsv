https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/school-choice-and-the-city-geographies-of-allocation-and-segregat	Urban research has increasingly acknowledged the significance of the social and spatial composition of schools in the broader socio-spatial dynamics of cities overall. With increasingly marketised education systems, parental choice of school is a key mechanism affecting wider urban processes such as gentrification. Most research into school choice in cities concentrates on the dynamics of choice (how and what parents say they choose). Fewer studies deal with the relationship between choice and the subsequent allocation of pupils to schools. This paper reports the findings of an international systematic review of the connections between parental choice and pupil allocation in school choice systems across the globe. We find that school choice is associated with higher levels of segregation of pupils from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds between schools. This finding is consistent across all types of choice mechanism, in different countries and cities, and across choice systems that have been in place for different lengths of time. The reasons behind the observed relationship are, however, highly localised and contextual, including particularities of the choice mechanism, social composition of neighbourhoods and mix of school types in a city. Increases in between-school segregation may lead to schools being more homogeneous in their social composition, with broader implications for social cohesion and educational inequalities in cities. Relating the findings to the broader urban school literatures, we suggest that scales and geographies of allocation are critical in understanding the dilemmas and dynamics of choice, the resultant inequalities, and any proposed interventions or solutions to reduce these inequalities.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/school-choice-in-london-and-paris-a-comparison-of-middle-class-st	Education is one major public service in which quasi-markets and other choice-based mechanisms are now established methods of delivery. The types of school people choose, and the extent to which their choices are realized, have a fundamental impact on the outcomes of any mechanism of school choice. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of the school choice strategies of middle-class families in London and Paris. We draw on approximately 200 in-depth interviews carried out across the two cities. This enables us to investigate the extent to which middle-class school choice strategies transcend the institutional context provided by both the local (state and private) schools market and national education policy in England and France. We discuss these findings in the context of current school choice policy and consider their implications for future policy design.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-an-interactive-sociological-rational-choice-approach-to-t	Understanding how different groups of users make choices is central to explaining the outcomes of choice-based mechanisms such as those observed in education systems across different national contexts. We discuss two established perspectives employed to explain decision-making in relation to class and education, and develop an argument for the superior explanatory potential of an elaborated, interactive, sociological rational choice perspective. We illustrate how this framework may be operationalised to inform policy aimed at reducing class differentials in school choice and subsequent educational outcomes in the context of New Public Management ideas. 
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/what-parents-want-school-preferences-and-school-choice	We investigate parents’ preferences for school attributes in a unique dataset of survey, administrative, census and spatial data. Using a conditional logit, incorporating characteristics of households, schools, and home-school distance, we show that most families have strong preferences for schools’ academic performance. Parents also value schools’ socio-economic composition and distance, which may limit the potential of school choice to improve academic standards. Most of the variation in preferences for school quality across socio-economic groups arises from differences in the quality of accessible schools rather than differences in parents’ preferences, although more advantaged parents have stronger preferences for academic performance.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/parental-choice-of-primary-school-in-england-what-types-of-school	This article focuses on the constraints on parental choice of school caused by geographical location, which arise due to the reliance on geographical proximity as the key oversubscription criterion for allocating school places. We investigate the assumption that most families really can choose between a range of different schools, and ask what types of school are genuinely accessible to different types of pupil. Using an innovative combination of survey and administrative data, we first determine what types of school are located near different family types. We then investigate how many of these different types of school are really available to the student, based on current catchment areas of schools and the home location of the child. This enables us to assess how access is determined by geography, and how it differs both by school type and by type of family. We show that using proximity as the main criterion to determine access to most schools affects pupils’ probability of securing a place at a particular school, with higher socio-economic status (SES) pupils being more likely to be accepted into (nearer) more advantaged schools. We argue that the large differences in the range of schools genuinely available to different families, coupled with the use of proximity as a tie-break device, continues to be a significant barrier to reducing inequality of access in the English school system.

Using data which matches individual pupils to individual teachers, and contains both test scores and value-added, we test whether the introduction of a payment scheme based on pupil attainment increased teacher effort. Our evaluation design controls for pupil effects, school effects and teacher effects, and adopts a difference-in-difference methodology. We find that the scheme did improve test scores and value added increased on average by about 40% of a grade per pupil.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/ethnic-segregation-and-educational-performance-at-secondary-schoo	Evidence suggests considerable variation among British ethnic groups in their performance at different stages of their educational careers. Many members of those groups are concentrated in particular parts of certain cities, and as a consequence many attend ethnically segregated schools. Using pupil-level and school-level data from the Pupil Level Annual School Census in England, we explore the relationship between performance and various student and school characteristics in Bradford (which has a large Pakistani population) and Leicester (with a large Indian population). We find evidence of a correlation between school ethnic composition and performance in Bradford but not in Leicester.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/what-gets-measured-gets-done-headteachers-responses-to-the-englis	English secondary schools operate within a performance management system, which includes league tables reporting school performance across a number of indicators. This article reports the results of an interview-based study, showing that head teachers care about their school's place in the league tables, and that they believe this system affects behaviour. The effects they identify include some unintended consequences, not necessarily related to improved overall school performance, including focusing on borderline students who can boost a pivotal indicator: the number of students gaining five A*-Cs at GCSE. This behaviour reflects, in part, the dual role played by headteachers: they are both educationalists (serving the interests of all pupils); and school marketers, concerned with promoting the school to existing and prospective parents. The behaviour is also consistent with economic theory, which predicts a focus on that which is measured, potentially at the expense of that which is important, in sectors characterised by incomplete measurement, by multiple stakeholders and containing workers with diverse objectives. We conclude that, given that performance indicators do affect behaviour, it is important to minimise unintended consequences, and we suggest how the use of value-added indicators of student performance may improve both what gets measured and what gets done in secondary schools.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/governing-and-contesting-marginality-muslims-and-urban-governance	Sites of Muslim settlement in the UK are frequently portrayed as poorly integrated and governed areas – a situation that is often attributed to the excessive cultural and religious accommodation of Muslim minorities under flawed policies of state multiculturalism. Through a case study of an English city, Birmingham, home to the UK’s largest Muslim population outside of London, I argue that sites of Muslim settlement have, rather, been subject to extraordinary and punitive governing practices. These governing practices moreover rely for their legitimacy on the portrayal of these sites as poorly integrated and governed. Nevertheless, whilst areas of Muslim settlement have been subject to spatially focused, punitive forms of governance, these have not necessarily been fully coherent and they have also been contested.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/acts-and-practices-of-citizenship-muslim-womens-activism-in-the-u	Drawing on the growing literature on Muslim women’s activism, this paper explores grammars of action that frame political mobilizations of Muslim women in the UK. By taking a broad view of political activism, we identify acts and practices of citizenship through which Muslim women activists engage with, reinterpret and challenge social norms. The article critically engages with dominant readings of post-migration minorities’ political mobilization through the lens of citizenship regimes and draws attention to more processual and agency-centred perspectives on citizenship. We focus on two salient themes that Bristol-based Muslim activists were concerned with: mobilizing against violence against women, manifested in the anti-FGM campaign by Integrate Bristol, and attempts to re-negotiate the terms of participation in religious spaces, manifested in claims for more inclusive mosques. In both instances, mobilization was not confined to the local community or national level, but supported by and embedded in related transnational struggles.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/governing-through-prevent-regulation-and-contested-practice-in-st	In this article, we consider the implications of the ‘Prevent’ strand of the government’s counter-terrorism strategy for the UK state’s engagement with Muslims. We argue that the logics of Prevent have been highly problematic for state–Muslim engagement. Nevertheless, we suggest that the characterisation of state approaches to engaging Muslims as a form of discipline is incomplete without an analysis of: first, differences in practices, habits and perspectives across governance domains; second, variations in approach and implementation between levels of governance; and third, the agency of Muslims who engage with the state. Through this approach we show how attention to the situated practices of governance reveals the contested nature of governing through Prevent.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-system-of-self-appointed-leaders-examining-modes-of-muslim-repr	In Britain since the turn of the century there has been a proliferation of Muslim civil society organisations and an increase in the number of points of contact between Muslim spokespersons and UK government representatives. Yet this rising participation of Muslims in UK governance has been a source of fierce controversies relating to the role of conservative male leaderships and the influence of radical Islamic groups. Drawing on interviews with 40 national elites who have engaged in UK Muslim-government relations in the past decade, this article charts the emergence of national-level Muslim representation and assesses the effect on democratic participation and accountability. Building on the work of Michael Saward, we argue that unelected civil society representatives can act as an important supplement to elected representatives. We show how four modes of Muslim representation have emerged in the last decade – delegation, authority, expertise and election – creating dynamic competition among representative claims.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/balancing-tolerance-security-and-muslim-engagement-in-the-united-	"In this article, we consider how engagement with Muslims by the state has been
conducted under the UK government’s counter-radicalisation ‘Prevent’ agenda. New Labour’s ‘hearts and minds’ approach to Prevent emphasised, and innovated, engagement with Muslim ‘communities’. This approach was widely criticised, however, particularly in the way it merged Prevent with ‘Community Cohesion’. By contrast, the current Coalition government’s new Prevent strategy operates with a much thinner conception of engagement and stipulates that in future, Prevent and cohesion work will be kept separate. This new strategy signals less community engagement and a hardened line on the types of Muslim groups that can be engaged with. However, local actors driven by operational or normative concerns are pursuing somewhat different objectives, often outside of central funding streams. Such unintentional localism may sustain more participatory and inclusive modes of engagement with Muslims."

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/contemporary-grammars-of-political-action-among-ethnic-minority-y-2	"Despite public and media attention to ethnic minority young people’s political engagement in recent times, often expressed in crisis narratives
about disengagement, disaffection or extremism, there has been little consideration of the range, or distinctive forms, of political action among
ethnic minority young people. The purpose of this article is to address this by presenting qualitative research on political activism among ethnic minority young people in Birmingham and Bradford. We find evidence for ‘new grammars of action’ and highly ‘glocal’ (as distinct from
transnational and diasporic) political orientations among the activists with whom we worked, as well as the significance of religious (as distinct from ethnic) identities in informing some activists’ political engagements. We conclude that, while there is evidence for changing political subjectivities, there is a need to take account of the interplay between old and new grammars of political action."
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/learning-from-political-sociology-structure-agency-and-inclusive-	"In this article, we consider the inclusion of children and young people in participatory governance processes. Whilst limitations are often evident in such processes, we argue that even participatory opportunities that are provided by the state and regarded as spaces into which citizens are invited can be ""conquered by civil society demands for inclusion"" (Cornwall and Coelho, 2006: 1). To this end, we suggest a practice-based and diachronic approach to studying the interactions between participatory structures and children and young people's agency. Being attentive to the agency of children and young people, and adopting a more diachronic approach to evaluating participatory initiatives, point to the possibility, we suggest, of seeing these relationships unfold in sometimes unexpected ways."
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/engaging-with-young-peoples-conceptions-of-the-political	"In many states, there are concerns about declining levels of political engagement and participation among young people. Our understanding of this decline, however, is limited because much of the research on youth politics is based on a narrow
conception of ‘the political’, little attempt is made to explore how people themselves define politics, non-participation is not adequately problematised, and there are insufficient youth-specific explanations for declining participation among young people. Drawing on fieldwork carried out in Britain, I argue there is a need to develop an approach and research methodology that engages with young people’s conceptions of the political."

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/pragmatic-ordering-informality-experimentation-and-the-maritime-s	The question of when and how international orders change remains a pertinent issue of international relations theory. This article examines the process of transformation emanating from the rise of the maritime security agenda as an exemplary case of international change. Investigating the evolution of maritime security and the diverse international responses to it, we develop the model of pragmatic ordering. The model of pragmatic ordering synthesises recent theoretical arguments for a focus on ordering advanced by advocates of practicetheory, pragmatist philosophy and related approaches. It also integrates evidence from recent global governance research. We propose a five stage model. According to the model, once a new problem emerges (problematisation), informality allows for experimenting with new practices and developing new knowledge (informalisation and experimentation). Once these experimental practices become codified, and survive contestation, they increasingly settle (codification) and are spread through learning and translation processes consolidation). We examine developments in the Western Indian Ocean region to illustrate each of these stages. The article draws attention to the substantialreorganisation of maritime space occurring over the past decade and offers an innovative approach for the study of orders and change.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/blue-crime-conceptualising-transnational-organised-crime-at-sea	Transnational organised crime at sea is a growing international concern. However, and despite its importance, the concept remains uncertain and contested. This ambiguity has led to a tendency to focus on individual challenges such as piracy or illegal fishing, rather than convergencies and synergies between and across issues, and has stymied a concerted international policy response. Debate continues over the term itself, what illicit activities it incorporates and excludes, and how these can be meaningfully conceptualised in ways that that both recognise the diverse nature of the concept yet also provide a basis for an integrated response to the challenges it presents. In this paper, we address this lacuna by providing a systemic conceptualisation and analysis of transnational organised crime at sea. Our goal is to provide a firm basis for future enquiries on the different types of blue crime, to trace their distinct characteristics and identify how they intersect, and to consider what kinds of synergies can be built to respond to them. In so doing, we organise the nascent academic and policy discourse on blue criminology and maritime security to provide a new framework for navigating this complex issue for practitioners and analysts alike. 
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/the-possibilities-and-limits-of-impact-and-engagement-in-research	Military geographical research often requires direct engagement with military institutions.  Although the morality of such engagements is often debated, the details of engagement in practice have been less scrutinised.  Scrutiny is important, as military engagements can shape research-derived critiques and can influence the communication of research outcomes to both military and academic research communities.  Military engagement comprises the communication of data, theories and concepts about military activities and phenomena, with military personnel and institutions, in textual, representational and interpersonal modes.   The paper examines Geography’s history of research engagement to show the complexities and debates around this seemingly straightforward idea.  It then introduces a research project and wider research programme on the UK Armed Forces Reserves that provides the empirical context from which we draw our observations about military engagement.  We then consider two issues, language and institutional cultures, for their insights into the complexities of military engagement.  We conclude by considering the politics of engagement in contemporary critical military geographical research.  
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/constructing-the-capable-state-contested-discourses-and-practices	Capacity building has risen to prominence in the vocabulary of the international community as a way to promote security and development in fragile and post-conflict environments. Capacity building seeks to promote a bottom up approach drawing on and strengthening existing local capacities. This article argues that capacity building can be understood as part of a broader governmentality that seeks to determine from the outside what constitutes a 'capable' subject. However, the effects of these governance practices are not straightforward as they are constantly shaped by the way local actors on the ground engage with these. Drawing on both policy documents and interviews conducted in Bosnia, Kosovo and Somalia, the article examines European Union (EU) capacity building initiatives in these post-conflict environments. By examining the rationality and problematisations behind this discourse, the article unveils how such assumptions (in particular, regarding the lack of institutions, power and knowledge) result in interactions and contestation between the local and the international in practice, which lead to new outcomes that neither straightforwardly reflect the existing status quo nor represent a linear imposition of power by external capacity builders.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/into-the-sea-capacity-building-innovations-and-the-maritime-secur	Maritime security capacity-building is a growing field of international activity. It is an area that requires further study, as a field in its own right, but also as an archetype to develop insights for capacity-building and security sector reform in other arenas. This article is one of the first to analyse this field of activity. Our empirical focus is on the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. Here, international actors have launched multiple capacity-building projects, initially in response to Somali piracy. We document the significance, extent and variety of capacity-building activities in this region and examine the ways in which capacity-building at sea has incorporated innovative characteristics that develop and expand the capacity-building agenda as traditionally understood. Our conclusion highlights the need to pay more attention to the maritime domain in international security and development studies and considers ways in which the maritime capacity-building experience may offer important lessons for other fields of international policy.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/maritime-security-the-uncharted-politics-of-the-global-sea	In this introduction to a special section of the September 2019 issue of International Affairs, we revisit the main themes and arguments of our article 'Beyond seablindness: A new agenda for maritime security studies', published in this journal in November 2017. We reiterate our call for more scholarly attention to be paid to the maritime environment in international relations and security studies. We argue that the contemporary maritime security agenda should be understood as an interlinked set of challenges of growing global, regional and national significance, and comprising issues of national, environmental, economic and human security. We suggest that maritime security is characterized by four main characteristics, including its interconnected nature, its transnationality, its liminality-in the sense of implicating both land and sea-A nd its national and institutional cross-jurisdictionality. Each of the five articles in the special section explores aspects of the contemporary maritime security agenda, including themes of geopolitics, international law, interconnectivity, maritime security governance and the changing spatial order at sea.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/militarization-stigma-and-resistance-negotiating-military-reservi	Set against the backdrop of the British Government’s Future Reserves 2020 (FR2020) programme, this article addresses military reservists’ experiences of how they are perceived by civilian colleagues in the workplace. Drawing on qualitative interviews with reservists, it analyses their understandings of civilian co-workers’ qualified and sometimes reluctant acceptance in light of FR2020’s implicit aim to use reservists to help realign civil–military relationships. While it appears that civilian work colleagues’ social distancing of reservists helps consolidate the wider public’s perceived lack of understanding of the British armed forces, a more critical view sees reservists’ largely unchallenged presence in the workplace as an exemplary, yet subtle instance of militarization. This is because reservists’ simultaneous (physical) inclusion and (social) distancing or stigmatization constitutes, and is constitutive of, their need to pass as civilian. In conclusion, we argue that a key implication of their passing as civilian is to neutralize debate of the legitimacy–or otherwise–of the armed forces as an institution tasked with violence on behalf of the state.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/eu-local-capacity-building-ownership-complexity-and-agency	This article argues that, despite considerable efforts, EU capacity building activities have struggled to deliver on their objectives. While such programmes have sometimes been able to strengthen pockets of capacity in specific organisations, they have had less success in building capacity in the round and in a sustainable manner. Drawing on empirical evidence from EU capacity building programmes in the Horn of Africa and the Western Balkans, the article shows that, to a great extent, this failure has been a consequence of the difficulties EU capacity builders have had in engaging with complex local actors and political contexts. This in turn has led to a ‘legitimacy deficit’ for EU programmes, which have often had little involvement from local stakeholders and knowledge, and whose goals have often been at odds with local preferences and priorities. 
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/beyond-seablindness-a-new-agenda-for-maritime-security-studies	This paper examines the rise of maritime security in concept and practice. We argue that developments in the maritime arena have flown beneath the radar of much mainstream international relations and security studies scholarship, and that a new agenda for maritime security studies is required. In this article we outline the contours of such an agenda, with the intention of providing orientation and direction for future research. Our discussion is structured into three main sections, each of which outlines a core dimension of the maritime security problem space. We begin with a discussion of the issues and themes that comprise the maritime security agenda, including how it has been theorised in security studies to date. Our argument is that the marine environment needs to be understood as part of an interlinked security complex, which also incorporates strong connections between land and sea. Second, we examine the ways in which maritime security actors have responded to these challenges in practice, focusing on issues of maritime domain awareness, coordination of action, and operations in the field. Third, we turn to the mechanisms through which the new maritime security agenda is being disseminated to local actors through a process of devolved security governance. We focus particularly on efforts to distribute knowledge and skills to local actors through capacity building and security sector reform. In the conclusion, we outline the future challenges for maritime security studies that follow from these observations.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/reserve-forces-and-the-transformation-of-british-military-organis	In recent years there has been a sharp growth in political and sociological interest in the British military. Set against the backdrop of the armed forces increasing presence in everyday life, alongside the organizations’ ongoing restructuring, the current paper focuses on the MoD’s problematic attempts to recruit 30,000 Reservists by 2020; what has become known as the Future Reserves 2020 programme (FR2020). We argue that these changes are driven in part by the need to cut costs in defence. However, we also suggest that that they are a reflection of the changing nature of modern military organisation, and the manner in which armed forces engage with the societies of which they are a part, and with the citizens that make up that society. We locate FR2020 programme in the context of a wider narrative about the changing nature of military organisation in contemporary western democracies, identifying structural, circumstantial and normative reasons for change. We also examine the specific challenges of implementing FR2020 in practice, including issues of recruitment and retention, integration and support, and relations with families and employers, drawing on the experience of comparator countries to do so. We conclude by considering the implications of these changes, both for the future of UK armed forces, and for the evolving nature of military-society relations in Britain.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/complexity-strategy-and-the-national-interest	British strategy making has been subject to a sustained critique in recent years, from parliamentarians, retired members of the armed forces and scholars of strategic studies. This article examines this nature of this critique and the evolving character of strategic practice it Britain. It argues that the criticisms of British strategy making are often misplaced, for two main reasons. First, many of them posit their critique on a reductionist notion of unitary ‘national interest’ that fails to capture systemic patterns of complexity and contestation in the wider security environment and at home. Second, they underestimate or ignore the extent to which the UK strategic community is itself innovating in response to these themes, particularly since the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. This is not to argue that considerable challenges do not remain for strategy making in Britain. Chief among these include how to translate strategic innovation in departments and elsewhere into a coherent national strategic agenda; how to do this while maintaining institutional coordination and a shared sense of strategic purpose across government (and beyond); how to sustain and consolidate institutional expertise and experience in a rapidly changing civil service and at a time of continuing public austerity; and how to articulate and legitimate security policy decisions amongst a general public that is both disengaged from elite strategic discourse and sceptical of the efficacy of military force. Even so, the article concludes by arguing that it is possible to see the outline of an emergent and distinctive theory of action in contemporary British strategic practice, characterised by principles of adaptivity, anticipation, self-organisation, and nascent cross-governmentalism.

However, illiberal actors and networks have persisted within the formal framework of democracy itself; coopting formal institutions to their own particularist interests and adapting to the constraints and opportunities of electoral competition. Though rooted in domestic political culture, this process can only be understood as part of a dynamic interaction with international policy. The project of liberal democracy in Serbia has thus become transnational; both underpinned and undermined by the actions and policies of external actors. 

Serbia has become a country where political contention is vigorous, but illiberal forces have shown an ability to adapt to the new conditions."
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/adapting-to-democracy-reflections-on-transition-in-serbia-and-the	This article aims to reflect on how we might best conceptualise political, economic and social change in Serbia and much of the rest of the Western Balkans today. The dominant paradigm through which this process has been understood has been one of democratic transition, albeit a transition that is an inevitably difficult, hesitant and long term process. The argument here is that while these democratisation approaches do offer some important insights about what is happening in Serbia, they also need to be treated with some caution. In particular, there is a danger that by accepting ‘transition’ as the primary framework through which we explain and understand change, we risk making a serious of misjudgements about the factors that actually constrain, limit and motivate domestic actors in transforming societies themselves.

These changes are increasingly challenging long-held assumptions about what armed forces are for and how they should be structured and organized. This article argues that these changes have not primarily occurred in response to an objective, functional reassessment of the nature of the threat, as is assumed in much of the civil-military relations literature. Instead, new military roles are emerging as a consequence of domestic and international socio-political influences that shape states' perceptions of what their armed forces should look like and the purposes they should serve.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/nato-and-its-new-members	NATO has had a major impact on defence reform in ten post-communist states that have either joined or been invited to join the Alliance. Through its own preconditionality and the motivating influence of membership, through technical advice and assistance and through propagating and spreading norms of behaviour, NATO has encouraged accession candidates to consolidate their arrangements for the democratic, civilian control of armed forces and helped to shape the direction of their military reform processes. More widely, these first two waves of eastward enlargement illustrate that political goals have increasingly outpaced NATO's traditional military priorities. Indeed, the military contribution that the new members can make to the Alliance will inevitably be limited, but the significance of enlargement as a motivation for and recognition of post-communist democratisation and structural change remains considerable.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/selective-photothermal-killing-of-cancer-cells-using-led-activate	The development of effective theranostic probes in cancer therapy is hampered due to issues with selectivity and off-target toxicity. We report the selective LED-photothermal ablation of cervical (HeLa) cancer cells over human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) using a new class of green-emissive fluorescent carbon dots (FCDs). The FCDs can be easily prepared in one-pot using cheap and commercial starting materials. Physico-chemical characterization revealed that a surface coating of 2,5-deoxyfructosazine on a robust amorphous core renders the nanomaterial’s unique properties. We show that intracellular uptake mostly involves passive mechanisms in combination with intracellular DNA interactions to target the nucleus and that cancer cell selective killing is likely due to an increase in intracellular temperature in combination with ATP depletion, which is not observed upon of exposure to either the core FCD or the surface component individually. The selectivity of these nanoprobes and the lack of apparent production of toxic metabolic byproducts, makes these new nanomaterials promising agents in cancer therapy.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/shrna-mediated-ppar%CE%B1-knockdown-in-human-glioma-stem-cells-reduces	The overall survival for patients with primary glioblastoma is very poor. Glioblastoma contains a subpopulation of glioma stem cells (GSC) that are responsible for tumour initiation, treatment resistance and recurrence. PPARα is a transcription factor involved in the control of lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. We have recently shown that PPARα gene and protein expression is increased in glioblastoma and has independent clinical prognostic significance in multivariate analyses. In this work, we report that PPARα is overexpressed in GSC compared to foetal neural stem cells. To investigate the role of PPARα in GSC, we knocked down its expression using lentiviral transduction with short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Transduced GSC were tagged with luciferase and stereotactically xenografted into the striatum of NOD-SCID mice. Bioluminescent and magnetic resonance imaging showed that knockdown (KD) of PPARα reduced the tumourigenicity of GSC in vivo. PPARα-expressing control GSC xenografts formed invasive histological phenocopies of human glioblastoma, whereas PPARα KD GSC xenografts failed to establish viable intracranial tumours. PPARα KD GSC showed significantly reduced proliferative capacity and clonogenic potential in vitro with an increase in cellular senescence. In addition, PPARα KD resulted in significant downregulation of the stem cell factors c-Myc, nestin and SOX2. This was accompanied by downregulation of the PPARα-target genes and key regulators of fatty acid oxygenation ACOX1 and CPT1A, with no compensatory increase in glycolytic flux. These data establish the aberrant overexpression of PPARα in GSC and demonstrate that this expression functions as an important regulator of tumourigenesis, linking self-renewal and the malignant phenotype in this aggressive cancer stem cell subpopulation. We conclude that targeting GSC PPARα expression may be a therapeutically beneficial strategy with translational potential as an adjuvant treatment.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/divergent-roles-for-antigenic-drive-in-the-aetiology-of-primary-v	CD8+ T-cell expansions are the primary manifestation of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), which is frequently accompanied by neutropenia and rheumatoid arthritis, and also occur as a secondary phenomenon in leukemia patients treated with dasatinib, notably in association with various drug-induced side-effects. However, the mechanisms that underlie the genesis and maintenance of expanded CD8+ T-cell receptor (TCR)-Vβ+ populations in these patient groups have yet to be fully defined. In this study, we performed a comprehensive phenotypic and clonotypic assessment of expanded (TCR-Vβ+) and residual (TCR-Vβ–) CD8+ T-cell populations in T-LGLL and dasatinib-treated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. The dominant CD8+ TCR-Vβ+ expansions in T-LGLL patients were largely monoclonal and highly differentiated, whereas the dominant CD8+ TCR-Vβ+ expansions in dasatinib-treated CML patients were oligoclonal or polyclonal, and displayed a broad range of memory phenotypes. These contrasting features suggest divergent roles for antigenic drive in the immunopathogenesis of primary versus dasatinib-associated CD8+ TCR-Vβ+ expansions.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/transplantation-of-allogeneic-pericytes-improves-myocardial-vascu	Background Transplantation of adventitial pericytes (APCs) promotes cardiac repair in murine models of myocardial infarction. The aim of present study was to confirm the benefit of APC therapy in a large animal model.Methods and Results We performed a blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled APC therapy trial in a swine model of reperfused myocardial infarction. A first study used human APCs (hAPCs) from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A second study used allogeneic swine APCs (sAPCs). Primary end points were (1) ejection fraction as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and (2) myocardial vascularization and fibrosis as determined by immunohistochemistry. Transplantation of hAPCs reduced fibrosis but failed to improve the other efficacy end points. Incompatibility of the xenogeneic model was suggested by the occurrence of a cytotoxic response following in vitro challenge of hAPCs with swine spleen lymphocytes and the failure to retrieve hAPCs in transplanted hearts. We next considered sAPCs as an alternative. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and functional/cytotoxic assays indicate that sAPCs are a surrogate of hAPCs. Transplantation of allogeneic sAPCs benefited capillary density and fibrosis but did not improve cardiac magnetic resonance imaging indices of contractility. Transplanted cells were detected in the border zone.Conclusions Immunologic barriers limit the applicability of a xenogeneic swine model to assess hAPC efficacy. On the other hand, we newly show that transplantation of allogeneic sAPCs is feasible, safe, and immunologically acceptable. The approach induces proangiogenic and antifibrotic benefits, though these effects were not enough to result in functional improvements.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/modest-interference-with-actin-dynamics-in-primary-t-cell-activat	Dynamic subcellular distributions of signaling system components are critical regulators of cellular signal transduction through their control of molecular interactions. Understanding how signaling activity depends on such distributions and the cellular structures driving them is required for comprehensive insight into signal transduction. In the activation of primary murine T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) signaling intermediates associate with various subcellular structures, prominently a transient, wide, and actin-associated lamellum extending from an interdigitated T cell:APC interface several micrometers into the T cell. While actin dynamics are well established as general regulators of cellular organization, their role in controlling signaling organization in primary T cell:APC couples and the specific cellular structures driving it is unresolved. Using modest interference with actin dynamics with a low concentration of Jasplakinolide as corroborated by costimulation blockade we show that T cell actin preferentially controls lamellal signaling localization and activity leading downstream to calcium signaling. Lamellal localization repeatedly related to efficient T cell function. This suggests that the transient lamellal actin matrix regulates T cell signaling associations that facilitate T cell activation.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/protein-distribution-during-human-erythroblast-enucleation-in-vit	Enucleation is the step in erythroid terminal differentiation when the nucleus is expelled from developing erythroblasts creating reticulocytes and free nuclei surrounded by plasma membrane. We have studied protein sorting during human erythroblast enucleation using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain pure populations of reticulocytes and nuclei produced by in vitro culture. Nano LC mass spectrometry was first used to determine the protein distribution profile obtained from the purified reticulocyte and extruded nuclei populations. In general cytoskeletal proteins and erythroid membrane proteins were preferentially restricted to the reticulocyte alongside key endocytic machinery and cytosolic proteins. The bulk of nuclear and ER proteins were lost with the nucleus. In contrast to the localization reported in mice, several key erythroid membrane proteins were detected in the membrane surrounding extruded nuclei, including band 3 and GPC. This distribution of key erythroid membrane and cytoskeletal proteins was confirmed using western blotting. Protein partitioning during enucleation was investigated by confocal microscopy with partitioning of cytoskeletal and membrane proteins to the reticulocyte observed to occur at a late stage of this process when the nucleus is under greatest constriction and almost completely extruded. Importantly, band 3 and CD44 were shown not to restrict specifically to the reticulocyte plasma membrane. This highlights enucleation as a stage at which excess erythroid membrane proteins are discarded in human erythroblast differentiation. Given the striking restriction of cytoskeleton proteins and the fact that membrane proteins located in macromolecular membrane complexes (e.g. GPA, Rh and RhAG) are segregated to the reticulocyte, we propose that the membrane proteins lost with the nucleus represent an excess mobile population of either individual proteins or protein complexes.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/isolation-and-characterization-of-human-interleukin-10-secreting-	Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the role of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, produced by multiple lineages of both human and murine T cells, in regulating the immune response. Here, we demonstrate that the small percentage of circulating CD4+ T cells that secrete IL-10 can be isolated from human peripheral blood and, importantly, we have optimized a protocol to expand these cells in both antigen-specific and polyclonal manners. Expanded CD4+IL-10+ T cells abrogate proliferation and T helper (Th) 1-like cytokine production in an antigen-specific manner, and to a lesser extent exhibit bystander suppressive capacity. CD4+IL-10+ T cells are suppressive in a cell contact-dependent way, though they do not require secretion of IL-10 for their suppressive role in vitro. CD4+IL-10+ T cells have an activated phenotype, with high expression of CD25, CD69, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, and are largely FoxP3 negative. This novel method for the isolation and expansion of suppressive IL-10-secreting T cells has important implications both for further research and clinical therapeutic development.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/phosphoinositide-3-kinase-gamma-gene-knockout-impairs-postischemi	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) plays a role in reparative neovascularization and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function.METHODS AND RESULTS: Unilateral limb ischemia was induced in mice lacking the PI3Kgamma gene (PI3Kgamma-/-) or expressing a catalytically inactive mutant (PI3Kgamma(KD/KD)) and wild-type controls (WT). Capillarization and arteriogenesis were reduced in PI3Kgamma-/- ischemic muscles resulting in delayed reperfusion compared with WT, whereas reparative neovascularization was preserved in PI3Kgamma(KD/KD). In PI3Kgamma-/- muscles, endothelial cell proliferation was reduced, apoptosis was increased, and interstitial space was infiltrated with leukocytes but lacked cKit+ progenitor cells that in WT muscles typically surrounded arterioles. PI3Kgamma is constitutively expressed by WT EPCs, with expression levels being upregulated by hypoxia. PI3Kgamma-/- EPCs showed a defect in proliferation, survival, integration into endothelial networks, and migration toward SDF-1. The dysfunctional phenotype was associated with nuclear constraining of FOXO1, reduced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation, and decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. Pretreatment with an NO donor corrected the migratory defect of PI3Kgamma-/- EPCs. PI3Kgamma(KD/KD) EPCs showed reduced Akt phosphorylation, but constitutive activation of eNOS and preserved proliferation, survival, and migration.CONCLUSIONS: We newly demonstrated that PI3Kgamma modulates angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and vasculogenesis by mechanisms independent from its kinase activity.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/role-of-kinin-b2-receptor-signaling-in-the-recruitment-of-circula	Reduced migratory function of circulating angiogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) has been associated with impaired neovascularization in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous findings underline the role of the kallikrein-kinin system in angiogenesis. We now demonstrate the involvement of the kinin B2 receptor (B(2)R) in the recruitment of CPCs to sites of ischemia and in their proangiogenic action. In healthy subjects, B(2)R was abundantly present on CD133(+) and CD34(+) CPCs as well as cultured endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from blood mononuclear cells (MNCs), whereas kinin B1 receptor expression was barely detectable. In transwell migration assays, bradykinin (BK) exerts a potent chemoattractant activity on CD133(+) and CD34(+) CPCs and EPCs via a B(2)R/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/eNOS-mediated mechanism. Migration toward BK was able to attract an MNC subpopulation enriched in CPCs with in vitro proangiogenic activity, as assessed by Matrigel assay. CPCs from cardiovascular disease patients showed low B(2)R levels and decreased migratory capacity toward BK. When injected systemically into wild-type mice with unilateral limb ischemia, bone marrow MNCs from syngenic B(2)R-deficient mice resulted in reduced homing of sca-1(+) and cKit(+)flk1(+) progenitors to ischemic muscles, impaired reparative neovascularization, and delayed perfusion recovery as compared with wild-type MNCs. Similarly, blockade of the B(2)R by systemic administration of icatibant prevented the beneficial effect of bone marrow MNC transplantation. BK-induced migration represents a novel mechanism mediating homing of circulating angiogenic progenitors. Reduction of BK sensitivity in progenitor cells from cardiovascular disease patients might contribute to impaired neovascularization after ischemic complications.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/characterisation-of-small-embedded-two-dimensional-defects-using-	Defect characterisation is an essential step of nondestructive testing which aims to determine the shape and the size of a defect once detected. The imaging algorithm multi-view Total Focusing Method (TFM) has been successfully used to accurately size defects of size greater than several times the wavelength. However, characterising smaller defects remains difficult due to the diffraction limit. This paper introduces a probabilistic characterisation technique where the unknown defect is compared against a database of reference scatterers obtainedwith an ultrasonic model. The measured TFM amplitudes act as a defect signature. A Bayesian framework is used to retrieve the reference defects which most credibly explain the measurements, and to calculate uncertainties.

https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/optimal-extraction-of-ultrasonic-scattering-features-in-coarse-gr	Ultrasonic array imaging is used in non-destructive testing for detection and characterisation of defects. The scattering behaviour of any feature can be described by a matrix of scattering coefficients, called the scattering matrix. This information is used for characterisation, and contrary to image-based analysis, the scattering matrix allows characterisation of defects at the subwavelength scale. However, the defect scattering coefficients are in practice contaminated by other nearby scatterers or significant structural noise. In this context, an optimal procedure to extract scattering features from a selected region of interest in a beamformed image is here investigated. This work proposes two main strategies to isolate a target scatterer in order to recover exclusively the time responses of the desired scatterer. In this paper such strategies are implemented in delay-and-sum and frequency-wavenumber forms, and optimised to maximise the extraction rate. An experimental case in a polycrystalline material shows that the suggested procedures provide a rich frequency spectrum of the scattering matrix and are readily suited to minimise the effects of surrounding scattering noise. In doing so, the ability to deploy imaging methods that rely on the scattering matrix is enabled.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/data-fusion-of-multi-view-ultrasonic-imaging-for-characterisation	The multi-view total focusing method (TFM) enables a region of interest within a specimen to be imaged using different ray paths and wave mode combinations. For defects larger than the ultrasonic wavelength, different portions of the same defect may manifest in a number of views. For a crack, the tip diffraction response may be evident in certain views and the specular reflection in others. Accurate characterisation of large defects requires the information in multiple views to be combined. In this work, three data fusion methodologies are presented: a simple sum over all views, a sum weighted according to the inverse of the noise in each view and a matched filter approach. Four large defects are examined, one stress corrosion crack (SCC), two weld cracks and a pair of slagline defects in a weld. The matched filter (matched to a small circular void) provided significant improvement over the best individual view. The data fusion process incorporates artefact removal, where non-defect artefact signals within each image view are identified and masked, using a single defect-free dataset for training. The matched filter was able to accurately visualise the full 3D extent of the four defects, allowing characterisation via the decibel drop method. When compared to x-ray CT and micrograph data in the case of the SCC, the matched filter fusion provided excellent agreement. Its performance was also superior to any individual view while providing a single fused image that is easier for an operator to interpret than a set of multi-view images. 
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/fatigue-crack-inspection-and-characterisation-using-non-collinear	In recent years, nonlinear ultrasonic techniques have been developed rapidly for defect detection and characterization at its early development stage. In this paper, non-collinear shear wave mixing is used for fatigue crack detection and characterization, exploring how orientation and size may be determined. This is achieved through measuring the amplitude of the generated longitudinal wave from a crack of interest. This amplitude is a function of the interaction angle and frequency ratio of two incident shear waves and the resulting amplitude parameter space is termed the nonlinear fingerprint of the crack. Numerical analysis of the nonlinear interaction between two incident shear waves and cracks was performed using two-dimensional finite element models to explore a broader parameter space than possible experimentally. It is shown that the interaction angle which leads to the maximum generated longitudinal wave amplitude is related to the orientation angle of the crack. To confirm these conclusions the model was validated using experimental measurements of vertical fatigue cracks grown using 3-point bending tests from initiation notches. The polarity flipping method was used to improve signal to noise ratio in such measurements. It is shown that there is a good agreement between the experimentally measured fingerprints and those simulated using finite element methods. Finally, an approximate method for sizing fatigue cracks was introduced that uses multiple non-collinear measurements along the crack length to determine its extent. As expected, the measured sizes from the proposed method indicate greater crack lengths than seen with linear ultrasonic phased array images due to the closed fatigue cracks being undetectable with linear arrays.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/fusion-of-multi-view-ultrasonic-data-for-increased-detection-perf	State-of-the-art ultrasonic Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) uses an array to rapidly generate multiple, information-rich views at each test position on a safety-critical component. However, the information for detecting potential defects is dispersed across views, and a typical inspection may involve thousands of test positions. Interpretation requires painstaking analysis by a skilled operator. In this paper various methods for fusing multi-view data are developed. Compared to any one single view, all methods are shown to yield significant performance gains, which may be related to the general and edge cases for NDE. In the general case, a defect is clearly detectable in at least one individual view, but the view(s) depends on the defect location and orientation. Here, the performance gain from data fusion is mainly due to the selective use of information from the most appropriate view(s) and fusion provides a means to substantially reduce operator burden. The edge cases are defects that cannot be reliably detected in any one individual view without false alarms. Here certain fusion methods are shown to enable detection with reduced false alarms. In this context, fusion allows NDE capability to be extended with potential implications for the design and operation of engineering assets
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-tensile-stress-on-inductively-coupled-piezoceram	This paper demonstrates that embedded piezoelectric sensors can survive loads much higher than predicted by their material properties. It shows the potential for piezoceramic sensors to estimate structural loads when embedded in composites. To show this, embedded sensors were subjected to stresses and strains which were signiﬁcantly greater than the recommended operating limits of their piezoceramic constituents. A novel data acquisition method enabled ultrasonic guided wave measurements to be recorded wirelessly from the embedded transducers, key to minimising the impact of embedded transducers. The data recorded by the piezoceramic transducers exhibited a reversible load dependence, with the measurements returning to the stress free values upon removal of the applied load. The guided wave measurements recorded by transducers embedded in glass ﬁbre reinforced composites showed no degradation after being subjected to tensile strains of 1.07%. When embedded in a carbon ﬁbre reinforced plastic sample which was loaded to failure, the transducers remained operational, however, sensor performance was shown to be degraded after being subjected to tensile stresses as high as 606 MPa. This offers the potential to build sensors to characterise overload in a component.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/acoustic-hologram-enhanced-phased-arrays-for-ultrasonic-particle-	The ability to shape ultrasound fields is important for particle manipulation, medical therapeutics, and imaging applications. If the amplitude and/or phase is spatially varied across the wave front, then it is possible to project “acoustic images.” When attempting to form an arbitrary desired static sound field, acoustic holograms are superior to phased arrays due to their significantly higher phase fidelity. However, they lack the dynamic flexibility of phased arrays. Here, we demonstrate how to combine the high-fidelity advantages of acoustic holograms with the dynamic control of phased arrays in the ultrasonic frequency range. Holograms are used with a 64-element phased array, driven with continuous excitation. Movement of the position of the projected hologram via phase delays that steer the output beam is demonstrated experimentally. This allows the creation of a much more tightly focused point than with the phased array alone, while still being reconfigurable. It also allows the complex movement at a water-air interface of a “phase surfer” along a phase track or the manipulation of a more arbitrarily shaped particle via amplitude traps. Furthermore, a particle manipulation device with two emitters and a single split hologram is demonstrated that allows the positioning of a “phase surfer” along a one-dimensional axis. This paper opens the door for new applications with complex manipulation of ultrasound while minimizing the complexity and cost of the apparatus.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-model-for-multiview-ultrasonic-array-inspection-of-small-two-di	The multiview total focusing method (TFM) is an imaging algorithm for ultrasonic full matrix array data that exploits internal reflections and mode conversions in the inspected object to create multiple images, the views. Modeling the defect response in multiview TFM is an essential first step in developing new detection and characterization methods that exploit the information present in these views. This paper describes a ray-based forward model for small 2-D defects and compares its results against finite-element simulations and experimental data for the inspection of a side-drilled hole, a notch, and a crack. A simpler version of this model, based on a single-frequency approximation, is derived and compared. A good agreement with the multifrequency model and a speedup of several orders of magnitude are achieved.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/acoustic-lock-position-and-orientation-trapping-of-non-spherical-	We demonstrate acoustic trapping in both position and orientation of a non-spherical particle of sub-wavelength size in mid-air. To do so, we multiplex in time a pseudo-one-dimensional vertical standing wave and a twin-trap; the vertical standing wave provides converging forces that trap in position, whereas the twin-trap applies a stabilising torque that locks the orientation. The device operates at 40 kHz, and the employed multiplexing ratio of the 2 acoustic fields is 100:50 (standing:twin) periods. This ratio can be changed to provide tunability of the relative trapping strength and converging torque. The torsional spring stiffness of the trap is measured through simulations and experiments with good agreement. Cubes from λ/5.56 (1.5 mm) to λ/2.5 (3.4 mm) side length were stably locked. We also apply this technique to lock different non-spherical particles in mid-air: cubes, pyramids, cylinders, and insects such as flies and crickets. This technique adds significant functionality to mid-air acoustic levitation and will enable applications in micro-scale manufacturing as well as containment of specimens for examination and 3D-scanning.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/characterization-of-nonlinear-ultrasonic-diffuse-energy-imaging	Nonlinear ultrasonic diffuse energy imaging is a highly sensitive method for the measurement of elastic nonlinearity. While the underlying principles that govern the technique are understood, the precise behavior and sensitivity have not previously been quantified. This article presents experimental, theoretical and numerical modeling studies undertaken to characterize nonlinear diffuse energy imaging. The influence of incoherent noise, elastic nonlinearity and instrumentation error are quantified. This work enables prediction of spatial sensitivity, aperture and amplitude dependence of the measurement, all of which moves the technique towards industrial viability. Further, while previous studies have focused on detection of closed cracks, the ultimate aim for nonlinear ultrasonic imaging in application to material testing is the detection of damage precursors, which requires a sensitivity to weak classical nonlinearity. This study identifies the experimental requirements necessary for this to be achieved, greatly expanding the potential applicability of nonlinear ultrasonic array imaging.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/diffuse-field-full-matrix-capture-for-near-surface-ultrasonic-ima	This article reports a technique for near-surface ultrasonic array imaging. Information equivalent to an undelayed full matrix of inter-element responses is produced through cross-correlation of a later time diffuse full matrix. This reconstructed full matrix lacks the nonlinear effects of early time saturation present in a directly acquired response. Consequently the near-surface material information usually obscured by this effect is retrieved. Furthermore it is shown that a hybrid full matrix formed through a temporally weighted sum of coherent and reconstructed matrices allows for effective near-surface and bulk material imaging from a single direct-contact experimental realisation.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/experimental-quantification-of-noise-in-linear-ultrasonic-imaging	An efficient procedure for experimental-based quantification of statistical distributions of both the random and micro-structural speckle noise within an ultrasonic image is presented. This is of particular interest in the multi-view total focusing method, which enables many images (views) of the same region to be obtained by utilising alternative ray paths and mode conversions. For example, in an immersion configuration, 21 separate views of the same region of a sample can be formed by exploiting direct and skip paths. These views can be combined through some form of data fusion algorithm, to improve defect detection and characterization performance. However, the noise level is different in different views and this should be accounted for in any data fusion algorithm. It is shown that by using only one set of experimental data from a single measurement location, rather than numerous independent locations, it is possible to obtain accurate noise parameters at an imaging level. This is achieved by accounting for the spatial variation in the noise parameters within the image, due to beam spread, directivity and attenuation with a simple empirical correction. An important feature of the process is the suppression of image artefacts caused by signal responses from other ray paths with the use of image masking. This masking process incorporates knowledge of the expected auto-correlation length (ACL) of image speckle noise and high amplitude cluster suppression. The expected ACL is determined via a simple ray-based forward model of a single point scatterer. Compared to the estimates obtained using multiple independent locations, the speckle noise parameters estimated from a single measurement location were within 0.4dB.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/nonlinear-non-collinear-ultrasonic-detection-and-characterisation	The development of cost effective and reliable bonded structures ideally requires an NDT method to detect the presence of poor quality, weak bonds or kissing bonds. If these bonds are more compliant in tension than in compression stress-strain nonlinearities provide a possible route to detection with the use of nonlinear ultrasonic techniques. This paper focuses on the kissing bond case and the resulting contact acoustic nonlinearity of the interface. A kissing bond is created by compression loading of two aluminium blocks. Non-collinear mixing of two shear waves producing a sum frequency longitudinal wave is the method of stimulation of contact acoustic nonlinearity in this research. The parametric space of the nonlinear mixing is measured in terms of interaction angle of the input beams and the ratio of their frequencies creating a ‘fingerprint’ of the sample's bulk and interface properties in the region where the beams overlap. The scattering fingerprint of a classically nonlinear solid is modelled analytically and a kissing interface is modelled numerically; these results are compared with experimentally measured values. The experimental interface is tested with varied interfacial loading, resulting in an increase in scattering amplitude as load is increased. Secondary peaks in the parameter space also appeared as loading increased, as well as other changes in the fingerprint pattern.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/strategies-for-data-acquisition-using-ultrasonic-phased-arrays	Ultrasonic phased arrays have produced major benefits in a range of fields, from medical imaging to non-destructive evaluation. The maximum information, which can be measured by an array, corresponds to the Full Matrix Capture (FMC) data acquisition technique and contains all possible combinations of transmitter-receiver signals. However, this method is not fast enough for some applications and can result in a very large volume of data. In this paper, the problem of optimal array data acquisition strategy is considered, that is, how to make the minimum number of array measurements without loss of information. The main result is that under the single scattering assumption the FMC dataset has a specific sparse structure, and this property can be used to design an optimal data acquisition method. An analytical relationship between the minimum number of array firings, maximum steering angle and signal-to-noise ratio is derived, and validated experimentally. An important conclusion is that the optimal number of emissions decreases when the angular aperture of the array increases. It is also shown that plane wave imaging data are equivalent to the FMC dataset, but requires up to an order of magnitude fewer array firings.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/monitoring-fatigue-crack-growth-using-nonlinear-ultrasonic-phased	Nonlinear imaging techniques have recently emerged which have the potential to detect material degradation and challenging defects, such as closed cracks. This paper describes an investigation into the performance of Nonlinear Ultrasonic Imaging (NUI) for the monitoring of the early stages of fatigue crack growth. This technique, in conjunction with conventional array imaging, is applied to the periodic monitoring of steel compact tension specimens subjected to high cycle fatigue loading. The detection limits of these techniques are investigated. Their abilities to localize and detect small cracks are further quantified with the aid of micrography. The results suggest that NUI is more sensitive than conventional ultrasonic imaging to the microscale changes occurring at the early stages of failure, i.e. detectability starts c. 15% of fatigue life. In addition to early detection, the potential for NUI to deliver accurate sizing of fatigue cracks and monitor crack propagation is also presented.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/realization-of-compact-tractor-beams-using-acoustic-delay-lines	A method for generating stable ultrasonic levitation of physical matter in air using single beams (also named tractor beams) is demonstrated. The method encodes the required phase modulation in passive unit cells into which the ultrasonic sources are mounted. These unit cells use waveguides such as straight and coiled tubes to act as delay-lines. It is shown that a static tractor beam can be generated using a single electrical driving signal and a tractor beam with one-dimensional movement along the propagation direction can be created with two signals. Acoustic tractor beams capable of holding millimeter-sized polymer particles of density 1.25 g/cm3 and fruit-flies (Drosophila) are demonstrated. Based on these design concepts we show that portable tractor beams can be constructed with simple components that are readily available and easily assembled  enabling applications in industrial contactless manipulation and biophysics.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/guided-wave-propagation-modelling-to-aid-understanding-of-acousti	The design of acoustic emission structural health monitoring systems often only considers the plate properties of a structure and not the features present. Here a practical modelling approach is demonstrated to aid the understanding of how wave propagation within a structure affects the performance of an acoustic emission system. Empirical models of a row of 5mm holes and a bolted L-section, a common feature in aerospace structures, are found from experimental results and incorporated in the system model. The model is used to assess which transducers acoustic emission events at different positions will trigger and how the position of transducers and the number of transducers used will affect event location error. This demonstrates potential uses of the modelling.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/monitoring-cure-and-detecting-damage-in-composites-with-embedded-	This paper demonstrates the capability of embedded piezoelectric sensors to monitor the state of health throughout the lifetime of composite structures. Sensors were embedded into fibre reinforced composites and used to monitor the progress of cure during manufacture, and the subsequent damage state of the cured part. The sensors used in this work consist of a single piezoelectric transducer, which is electronically connected to an inductance coil. A probe containing two inductance coils was used to make wireless ultrasonic measurements. When the probe was placed in close proximity to an embedded sensor, the electromagnetic coupling between the coils in probe and the embedded coil, allowed electronic signals to be wirelessly transferred between the transducer and the ultrasonic processing equipment. Two different inductively coupled transducer systems (ICTS) were used to monitor cure. A ICTS which generated bulk waves monitored the cure of a thick glass fibre section, and an ICTS which generated guided elastic waves monitored the cure of a large glass fibre plate. To characterise the cure monitoring ability of each ICTS, two established cure monitoring techniques; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dielectric analysis, were used to record measurements during cure. The guided wave ICTS was then used to detect barely visible impact damage (BVID), created by a 10 Joule impact at a distance of 300 mm from the sensor embedded in the large glass fibre plate.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/the-anisotropic-propagation-of-ultrasonic-guided-waves-in-composi	Ultrasonic guided wave propagation in anisotropic attenuative materials like CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) is much more complicated than in isotropic materials. Propagation phenomena need to be understood and quantified before reliable NDE (Non-destructive Evaluation)/SHM (Structural Health Monitoring) inspection systems can be realized. The propagation characteristics: energy velocity, dispersion, mode coupling, energy focusing factor and attenuation are considered in this paper. Concepts of minimum resolvable distance and sensitivity maps are extended to anisotropic attenuative materials in order to provide the means for comparison of different guided wave modes in composite materials. The paper is intended to serve as a framework for evaluating and comparing different modes and choosing the optimum operating conditions (frequency, sensor layout) for possible NDE/SHM applications on composite materials. Fundamental guided wave modes in the low frequency regime for highly anisotropic CFRP plates are investigated experimentally and theoretically and the implications for NDE/SHM are discussed.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/design-of-an-embedded-sensor-for-improved-structural-performance	Low velocity impact damage to composite laminates can result in a complicated network of matrix cracks and delaminations beneath the laminates surface, which are extremely difficult to detect by visual inspection. Current non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques such as ultrasonic C-scan and x-ray imaging create significant downtime, which leads to costly inspection programmes. Embedded sensors offer the potential to increase the automation of inspection, and decrease the downtime when compared with current NDE practices. However, for such systems to be practical, sensors must be integrated within composite structures without producing unacceptable loss of structural performance. This paper identifies techniques for embedding slim sensors with comparatively large in-plane dimensions inside composite materials. Interlaminar shear strength tests were used to identify an encapsulating layer for the sensors. Flexural strength testing was carried out on laminates containing sensors embedded towards the compressive surface of flexural specimens. The experimental study was complemented with finite element analysis, which identified the load paths within different embedment configurations and aided with the interpretation of the experimental results. The results show that with careful selection of sensor materials, geometry, embedding location and embedment technique, sensors can be integrated within composite structures without producing any significant reduction of mechanical performance.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/remote-inspection-system-for-impact-damage-in-large-composite-str	A significant opportunity for reducing the weight of composite aircraft is through the development of an economically efficient method to detect barely visible or invisible impact damage sustained in service. In this paper, a structurally integrated, inert, wireless system for rapid, large-area impact damage detection in composite is demonstrated. Large-area inspection from single sensors using ultrasonic-guided waves is achieved with a baseline-subtraction technique. The wireless interface uses electromagnetic coupling between coils in the embedded sensor and inspection wand. Compact encapsulated sensor units are built and successfully embedded into composite panels at manufacture. Chirp-based excitation is used to enable single-shot measurements with high signal-to-random-noise ratio to be obtained. Signal processing to compensate for variability in inspection wand alignment is developed and shown to be necessary to obtain adequate baseline subtraction performance for damage detection. Results from sensors embedded in both glass fibre and carbon fibre-reinforced composite panels are presented. Successful detection of a 10 J impact damage in the former is demonstrated at a range of 125 mm. Quantitative extrapolation of this result suggests that the same level of impact damage would be detectable at a range of up to 1000 mm with an inspection wand alignment tolerance of 4 mm.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-temperature-variations-on-ultrasonic-guided-wave	Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials are lightweight and corrosion-resistant and therefore are increasingly used in aerospace, automotive and construction industries. In Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications of CFRP materials, ultrasonic guided waves potentially offer large area inspection or inspection from a remote location. This paper addresses the effect of temperature variation on guided wave propagation in highly anisotropic CFRP materials. Temperature variations cause changes in guided wave velocity that can in turn compromise the baseline subtraction procedures employed by many SHM systems for damage detection. A simple model that describes the dependence of elastic properties of the CFRP plates on temperature is presented in this paper. The model can be used to predict anisotropic velocity changes and baseline subtraction performance under varying thermal conditions. The results produced by the model for unidirectional and 0/90 CFRP plates are compared with experimental measurements.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/modelling-harmonic-generation-measurements-in-solids	Harmonic generation measurements typically make use of the plane wave result when extracting values for the nonlinearity parameter, beta, from experimental measurements. This approach, however, ignores the effects of diffraction, attenuation, and receiver integration which are common features in a typical experiment. Our aim is to determine the importance of these effects when making measurements of beta over different sample dimensions, or using different input frequencies. We describe a three-dimensional numerical model designed to accurately predict the results of a typical experiment, based on a quasi-linear assumption. An experiment is designed to measure the axial variation of the fundamental and second harmonic amplitude components in an ultrasonic beam, and the results are compared with those predicted by the model. The absolute b values are then extracted from the experimental data using both the simulation and the standard plane wave result. A difference is observed between the values returned by the two methods, which varies with axial range and input frequency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/nonlinear-ultrasonic-phased-array-imaging	This Letter reports a technique for the imaging of acoustic nonlinearity. By contrasting the energy of the diffuse field produced through the focusing of an ultrasonic array by delayed parallel element transmission with that produced by postprocessing of sequential transmission data, acoustic nonlinearity local to the focal point is measured. Spatially isolated wave distortion is inferred without requiring interrogation of the wave at the inspection point, thereby allowing nonlinear imaging through depth.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/numerical-and-experimental-study-of-the-nonlinear-interaction-bet	The nonlinear interaction of shear waves with a frictional interface are presented and modeled using simple Coulomb friction. Analytical and finite difference implementations are proposed with both in agreement and showing a unique trend in terms of the generated nonlinearity. A dimensionless parameter ξ is proposed to uniquely quantify the nonlinearity produced. The trends produced in the numerical study are then validated with good agreement experimentally. This is carried out loading an interface between two steel blocks and exciting this interface with different amplitude normal incidence shear waves. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical results, suggesting the simple friction model does a reasonable job of capturing the fundamental physics. The resulting approach offers a potential way to characterize a contacting interface; however, the difficulty in activating that interface may ultimately limit its applicability.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/pulse-echo-harmonic-generation-measurements-for-non-destructive-e	Ultrasonic harmonic generation measurements have shown great potential for detecting nonlinear changes in various materials. Despite this, the practical implementation of the technique in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) has typically been limited to the through transmission setup case, with which problems arise in certain situations. Recently, works in the fields of nonlinear fluids and biomedical imaging have reported different application of the harmonic generation theory by making use of reflective boundaries and beam focusing. It is thought that such techniques may be similarly applied in the field of NDE to enable single-sided nonlinear inspection of components. In this paper, we initially describe a numerical model which has been used to determine the effects of attenuation and acoustic beam diffraction on measurements of the nonlinear parameter beta. We then extend the model to incorporate first the effects of multiple reflecting boundaries in the propagation medium, then of focused source excitation. Simulations, supported by experimental data, show that nonlinear pulse-echo measurements have the potential to provide a viable (and practical) alternative to the usual through-transmission type as a means of measuring beta in solids. Furthermore, it is shown that such measurements may be optimised, both by adjusting the excitation frequency, and by focusing the acoustic source at a certain point relative to the specimen boundary.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/chirp-excitation-of-ultrasonic-guided-waves	Most ultrasonic guided wave methods require tone burst excitations to achieve some degree of mode purity while maintaining temporal resolution. In addition, it is often desirable to acquire data using multiple frequencies, particularly during method development when the best frequency for a specific application is not known. However, this process is inconvenient and time-consuming, particularly if extensive signal averaging at each excitation frequency is required to achieve a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. Both acquisition time and data storage requirements may be prohibitive if responses from many narrowband tone burst excitations are measured. Here chirp excitations are utilized to address the need to both test at multiple frequencies and achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio to minimize acquisition time. A broadband chirp is used to acquire data at a wide range of frequencies, and deconvolution is applied to extract multiple narrowband responses. After optimizing the frequency and duration of the desired tone burst excitation, a long-time narrowband chirp is used as the actual excitation, and the desired tone burst response is similarly extracted during post-processing. Results are shown that demonstrate the efficacy of both broadband and narrowband chirp excitations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/continuous-baseline-growth-and-monitoring-for-guided-wave-shm	It has been shown by many authors that temperature effect compensation is a necessity for the realization of a reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) system. However, there exist practical issues related to the acquisition of baseline signals, required for temperature compensation methods to work effectively, such as degenerate baseline signals recorded at the same temperature and a long acquisition period before monitoring is started. An alternative approach for the acquisition of baseline signals is presented in this paper. The algorithm makes the acquisition an evolutionary process, integrated in the damage detection procedures. The algorithm is shown to be successful in generating a concise set of baselines that guarantees efficient performance of temperature compensation methods, leading to computation time and computer memory savings. Its capabilities in detecting simulated abrupt and slowly evolving damages have also been tested.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/investigation-of-capacitively-coupled-ultrasonic-transducer-syste	Capacitive coupling offers a simple solution to wirelessly probe ultrasonic transducers. This paper investigates the theory, feasibility and optimization of such a capacitively coupled transducer system (CCTS) in the context of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) applications. The non-contact interface relies on an electric field formed between four metal plates, two of which are physically connected to the electrodes of a transducer while the other two are in a separate probing unit connected to the transmit/receive channel of the instrumentation. The complete system is modelled as an electric network with the measured impedance of a bonded piezoelectric ceramic disc representing a transducer attached to an arbitrary solid substrate. A transmission line model is developed, which is a function of the physical parameters of the capacitively coupled system such as the permittivity of the material between the plates, the size of the metal plates, and their relative position. This model provides immediate prediction of electric input impedance, pulse-echo response and the effect of plate misalignment. The model has been validated experimentally and has enabled optimization of the various parameters. It is shown that placing a tuning inductor and series resistor on the transmitting side of the circuit can significantly improve the system performance in terms of the signal to cross talk ratio. Practically, bulk wave CCTSs have been built and demonstrated for underwater and through-composite testing. It has been found that electrical conduction in the media between the plates limits their applications.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/investigation-of-inductively-coupled-ultrasonic-transducer-system	Inductive coupling offers a simple solution to wirelessly probe ultrasonic transducers. This paper investigates the theory and feasibility of such an inductively coupled transducer system in the context of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) applications. The noncontact interface is based on electromagnetic coupling between three coils; one of the coils is physically connected to the transducer, the other two are in a separate probing unit, where they are connected to the transmit and receive channels of the instrumentation. The complete system is modeled as a three-port network with the measured impedance of a bonded piezoelectric ceramic disc representing a sensor attached to an arbitrary solid substrate. The developed transmission line model is a function of the physical parameters of the electromagnetic system, such as the number of turns and diameter of each coil, and their separation. This model provides immediate predictions of electrical input impedance and pulse-echo response. The model has been validated experimentally and a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters performed. This has enabled optimization of the various parameters. Inductively coupled transducer systems have been built for both bulk and guided wave examples. By using chirped excitation and baseline subtraction, inspection distance of up to 700 mm is achieved in single-shot, guided-wave pulse-echo mode measurements with a 5 mm separation between the probing coils and transducer coil on an aluminum plate structure. In the bulk wave example, a delamination in an 8.9-mm-thick carbon fiber composite specimen is successfully identified from the changes in the arrival time of a reflected pulse.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/statistically-based-damage-detection-in-geometrically-complex-str	This article introduces a novel approach to damage detection in the context of a structural health monitoring system. A statistical model of the ultrasonic guided wave interrogation process was developed and used to formulate a likelihood ratio test. From the likelihood ratio test, the optimal detector for distinguishing damaged and undamaged states of the structure was derived and found to be a metric related to signal energy. That result was confirmed using a data-driven approach based on using receiver-operating characteristic curves to compare the energy metric to other metrics found in the literature. The data in this study were generated from instrumenting two separate, geometrically complex structures with ultrasonic sensor-actuators. A three-story bolted-frame structure was constructed in the laboratory to test the approach for connections that produce highly uncertain wave paths, with damage being introduced through local impedance changes and bolt loosening. The second test structure was a section of a fuselage rib taken from a commercial aircraft in which holes and cracks were introduced to provide a testbed with a high degree of realism. The detection performance in both structures was quantified and presented. Finally, different sensor fusion strategies were implemented and the ability of such techniques to increase the statistical distinction between damaged and undamaged cases was quantified.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/enhanced-detection-through-low-order-stochastic-modeling-for-guid	Guided wave structural health monitoring offers the potential for efficient defect detection and localization on large plate-like structures. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the performance of guided wave structural health monitoring on complex structures can be quantified, predicted, and enhanced through basic stochastic modeling and application of a likelihood-based detector. These are necessary steps in enabling such structural heath monitoring techniques to be used more robustly on safety-critical structures. Extensive ensembles of measurements were taken using a sparse array of transducers on an aluminum plate with geometric complexities (stiffeners), before and after introducing several sizes of damage at several locations, and in the presence of large noise processes. This enabled a full statistical treatment of performance evaluation using a modification of the standard receiver operating characteristic curve. The incorporation of stochastic modeling produced on average a 44% reduction in missed detections among the damage modes tested, with up to a 95% reduction in some cases. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.
https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/measuring-bulk-material-nonlinearity-using-harmonic-generation	The mechanisms by which a travelling wave propagates through a nonlinear medium are of interest due to the large research effort aimed at exploiting its potential in assessing the damage state of structures. Typically measurements are made to track changing signal nonlinearity due to damage on a single specimen geometry. In this special case relative changes in signal nonlinearity are potentially sufficient to indicate damage. A more robust technique would allow the signal nonlinearity to be related back to the strength of the underlying nonlinear mechanism. In the case of measuring harmonic signal generation in a medium exhibiting a bulk material nonlinearity, a nonlinear parameter exists that relates the material nonlinearity to the measured harmonic signal. However, it is based on the assumption that there is no damping and the excitation is continuous. This paper focuses on assessing the effects of damping, excitation type and signal processing window on the harmonic measurement. Using perturbation and multiple scales techniques, a theoretical model of the generation of nonlinearity is derived. A numerical solution is also developed and both approaches show that the nonlinear parameter first increases and then converges with propagation distance due to the presence of damping. This is experimentally verified. The models also capture the effects of excitation type and signal processing window and using them a correction factor is proposed that accounts for all these effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
